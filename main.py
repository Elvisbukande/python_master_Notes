# print("Hello class")

# x = "Ben"
# print(x)
# make your variables descriptive
# name = "Ben"
# print(name)

# Data types( what type of data the variable holds)
# These could be  a number, a word, boolen, an integer etc
#  examples
#  1)integers are referred to as int(positive and negative whole numbers)
# 2)a float is a decimal number( not whole numbers  eg 1.2)
# 3) strings ( a sequence of characters in  double quotes)

#  how do you know the data type 
# x = 1
# print(type(x))

# 4)list is a collection represented by a squre bracket
# names = ["Ben", "Jone", "Boy"]
# print (names)

#  Note with  a list you can replace values of the variable
# t_names = ["Ben", "Jone", "Boy"]
# t_names[2] = "Eric"
# print(t_names)

# 5) turples
#  Note with  a list you CANNOT replace values of the variable
# t_names = ("Ben", "Jone", "Boy")
# t_names[2] = "Eric"
# print(t_names) this output will not work


# python operations
# addition
# x=1
# y=2
# print(x+y) output is 3

x=1
y=2
print("x+y") #output is x+y

# sutraction
# multiplication
# modulus you care only about the remender
# floor division you are interested in the numerator/whole numbers
