# Explanation:
# Environment Variables:

# ACTION: You can set it to "start" or "stop" when scheduling the Lambda function.
# TAG_KEY: (optional) The key used to filter instances by their tags (default: "Scheduler").
# get_instances_by_tag():

# Filters EC2 instances based on the tag key (Scheduler by default) and the action (start or stop).
# start_instances() / stop_instances():

# These functions handle starting and stopping instances, respectively, using the EC2 API.
# Deployment Steps:
# Create IAM Role: Ensure the Lambda execution role has the following permissions for EC2 actions:

# json
# Copy code
# {
#     "Effect": "Allow",
#     "Action": [
#         "ec2:DescribeInstances",
#         "ec2:StartInstances",
#         "ec2:StopInstances"
#     ],
#     "Resource": "*"
# }
# Create Lambda Function:

# Open AWS Lambda and create a new function.
# Choose the execution role created above.
# Copy and paste the Python code.
# Set Environment Variables:

# In the Lambda function, set the environment variable ACTION to either start or stop depending on the function's purpose.
# Optionally set TAG_KEY if you're using a different tag key than Scheduler.
# Set CloudWatch Rule:

# Go to CloudWatch > Rules and create a new rule.
# Use the "Schedule" option to specify when you want to trigger the function (e.g., every day at 8 AM to start instances).
# Set the rule to trigger the Lambda function with the appropriate environment variables (like starting or stopping).
# Cost-saving Example:
# Tag your instances:
# Add a tag like Scheduler=start or Scheduler=stop to EC2 instances.
# Create two Lambda functionsâ€”one to start instances (with ACTION=start) and another to stop instances (with ACTION=stop).
# Schedule the functions with CloudWatch, such as starting instances at 8 AM and stopping them at 6 PM.
# By doing this, your EC2 instances will automatically start and stop based on your schedule, helping you optimize costs.
